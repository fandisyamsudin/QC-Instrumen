## Connecting

### USB 3 Type C

The FunBoard connects to your laptop or desktop using a **USB 3 Type C** cable. When connected, the USB port is converted to TTY serial by a **Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge IC**. If you are using Linux or OSX, these drivers should be included in the Kernel (or you definitely need an update). For Windows you will need to install the driver. You can get it here: [Silicon Labs Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

### Putty

I will add this soon.

### Picocom

In Linux, you must add your username to the `dialout` group and then **log out** or **reboot**.
```
sudo adduser your_username dialout
```

Install:
```
sudo apt install picocom
```

Connect:
```
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB1
```
Be sure to set your port to the correct one.

Disconnect:

Use `ctrl-a crtl-x` to exit picocom and return to the command prompt.

### Python + PySerial

Ref: [PySerial Docs](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/)

Add your username to the `dialout` group and then **log out** or **reboot**.
```
sudo adduser your_username dialout
```

Add the PySerial module from the command line:
```
python3 -m pip install pyserial
```

Basic usage in Python:
```
uart = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB1',115200) # 9600,8,N,1 is default

uart.open()
uart.read(1024)
uart.write(b'some bytes')
uart.close()
```

Or this:
```
uart = serial.Serial()
uart.baudrate = 115200
uart.port = '/dev/ttyUSB1'
uart.timeout = 0

uart.open()
uart.read(1024)
uart.write(b'some bytes')
uart.close()
```

## Built In Functions

The FunBoard comes with software to support all of the attached board peripherals like the MicroSD card, the leds, beeper, etc.
There are also a lot of convenience functions included for common events such as connecting to WiFi, file and directory management, and using the Real-Time-Clock.

Most of the class names are self-explanatory, but be sure to have a look at the obscure ones like **st**, which has lots of handy functions for exploring the file system, and **esp32**, which has some *esp32-specific* functions.

### beeper
This modules controls the onboard **buzzer**. You can set the module default values before calling the functions, or you can provide values when the functions are called.

Here are default values:
- `beeper.freq` - Frequency integer = 2200 
- `beeper.freq2` - Second frequency integer for `beep2` = `beeper.freq*2`
- `beeper.secs` - Beep duration milliseconds = 0.125
- `beeper.duty` - Percent duty cycle for PWM = 25
- `beeper.vol` - Volume percent = 100
- `beeper.wait` - Pause between beeps = `beeper.secs/2'
- `beeper.fcps` - Number of frequency changes per second for `beep2` = 100
- `beeper.root` - Root frequency for `play` = 440
- `beeper.beat` - Beat length for `play` = 0.125

Here are the functions:
- `beeper.beep(freq=None,secs=None,vol=None,duty=None)` - Beep the buzzer. No values are required (will use defaults). 
- `beeper.beepn(count=1,freq=None,secs=None,vol=None,duty=None,wait=None)` - Beep the buzzer `n` times. No values are required (will beep once using defaults).
- `beeper.beep2(freq=None,freq2=None,secs=None,vol=None,duty=None,fcps=100)` - Beep the buzzer, but change from `freq` to `freq2` over `secs` seconds. No values are required (will use defaults).
- `beeper.play(notestring=None,root=None,beat=None,vol=None,duty=None)` - Play a song (a string of notes). No values are required (will play `beeper.shave_notes`).

Here is the song-string syntax:
- notestring - Any string of a `note/pause + optional_sharp + octave + beats` sequences.
- note - Any character in "ABCDEFG" or "abcdefg".
- sharp - The pound character "#" makes a note sharp (there are no flats, so use a sharp).
- octave - Any digit 0-9. This designates the octave to use. Note that octaves 0, 1, 2 and 9 may not play of be audible to adults.
- beats - Any non-negative integer. This is the duration of the note in beats (default is 1). There are no partials, so make your `beeper.beat` length match the smallest partial note.
- pause - Either a "P" or "p" character. Works the same as a note, but does nothing for the given beat.
- caps-spaces-other - Ignored. "d44" == "D44" == "d 4 4" == "d, 4, 4" == "D4-4"
- example - Middle C for 3 beats = 'C43'
- example - A pause for 3 beats = 'P3' or 'P03'

These are built in:
- `beeper.jingle_notes` - Jingle (plays on boot) = 'e5 g5 b5 d6 p d5'
- `beeper.jingle2_notes` - Jingle2 (plays after boot) = 'd7'
- `beeper.shave_notes` - Included song *Shave and a Haircut* = 'c4 p g3 g3 a32 g32 p p b3 p c4'
- `beeper.axelf_notes` - Included sing *Axel-F* = 'd44 f43 d42 d41 g42 d42 c42 d44 a43 d42 d41 a#42 a42 f42 d42 a42 d52 d41 c42 c41 a32 e42 d46'

### led
Control the **Blue LED**.
- `led.on()` - Turn the blue LED on.
- `led.off()` - Turn the blue LED off.
- `led.blink(count=1,ontime=None,offtime=None)` - Blink the blue LED. You can set the number of blinks using `count=n`. You can also set the `ontime` and `offtime` in milliseconds. Defaults are on for 50ms and off for 250ms.
- `led.pwmx(force=False)` - Turn of pulse-width modulation (see below). You can also use `led.off()`.
- `led.pwm(percent=100)` - Turn on blue LED using pulse-width modulation. This allows you to control brightness. Provide an integer percent from 0 (off) to 100 (full brightness).
- `led.pwm2(start=0,end=100,pause=10)` - Progressive change of blue LED from `start` percent to `end` percent, pause `pause` milliseconds between steps (sets how long the transition tales). This allow a fade in, fade out option.

### pixels
Control the **MicroPixels** RGB smart LEDs.

The micropixels are controlled by providing a pixel address, a color tuple of RGB, and a brightness. The `pixels` class has a default brightness (32 out of 255), and it provides a dictionary of basic colors which can be referenced using a name string instead of a tuple. Values for both brightness and RGB levels are integers from **0** to **255**. Pixels are addressed from 7 to 0, from left to right (like bits in MSB order).

- `pixels.off()` - Turn off all pixels.
- `pixels.set_brightness(brightness=0)` - Set the default brightness value 0 to 255.
- `pixels.clist()` - Print the included basic colors to screen.
- `pixels.colors` - A dictionary of basic color names and color values.
- `pixels.get_color(color,brightness=None)` - Get an RGB tuple for the given color tuple/name at the given or default brightness. Defaults to `'white'` at the default brightness.
- `pixels.setp(pixel,color,brightness=None,write=True)` - Set the pixel at address `pixel` to the given `color` using a given `brightness` (or the default). If `write` is False, set the value in memory but don't update the pixels. Otherwise, update the pixels.
- `pixels.sweep(color=None,brightness=None,ontime=25,offtime=5)` - Do an up-and-back sweep of the pixels using the given values. No values are required.

### rtc
**Real-Time Clock** functions. 
- `rtc.ntp_set()` - Set local time using network time server. Requires an established WiFi connection. May time out without setting (not sure why at this point). If it fails, let the connection stabilize and try again.
- `rtc.set(datetime_tuple)` - Set local time manually. `datetime_tuple = (year,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds)`
- `rtc.get()` - Get local time as a tuple of numbers. `datetime_tuple = (year,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds)`
- `rtc.linux_epoch` - Get the Linux epoch time integer (seconds since Jan 1 1970). Differs from ESP32 time stamp.
- `rtc.dtstamp` - Get local time as a string: `2021-05-27 18:42:35 UTC`

- `sdcard.unmount()` - Unmount any SD card (before removing it).
