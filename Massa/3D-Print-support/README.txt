# Summary

*** Update 2018-10-02 ***
The base was a bit weak so I added a new one that will handle up to 5 kg if printed in PLA - more if you use stronger plastics.

When prototyping a project that includes a weight sensor, building a mock-up for the sensor is often difficult, time consuming and low precision.
These two prints make up a simple test bed for low load prototyping.
Printed in PLA it's good for at least 1 kg, more if you use more exotic filaments.
This is designed to match a very common type of load cell, 80x12,7x12,7 mm, hole spacing 15 mm.
If you have a load cell of a different size I would be happy to make a version to that specification. Get in touch.
The bottom part looks like the Mercedes star, but that's purely coincidental.


# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Clone
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2 mm layers works fine.
Infill: 30% or so.
Filament_brand: Any
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
Supports are needed for the screw heads.
I suspect it might work without supports but I haven't tried it.
I set supports to have as large offset as possible, as this makes them easy to remove.

# Post-Printing

Remove the support material from the screw holes.
For the base I used M5x16 cap heads, and for the top I used slotted M4*16 as that's what I found in the pile on my table.

# How I Designed This

Sketchup.
Too bad they stopped developing Make. The online version s*cks.
